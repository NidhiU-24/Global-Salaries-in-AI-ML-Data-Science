## Problem Selection
The exploration of global salaries in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science is a crucial undertaking with far-reaching implications. As technology continues to evolve, these domains have become integral components of industries driving demand for skilled professionals. Analyzing salary data across work years, experience levels, employment types, and job titles provides valuable insights into the economic landscape of these rapidly growing sectors.
